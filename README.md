After your done naming the bot
We need to actually make the bot.
First of all go to this section when you created your application:

you should see this:

Now to get the Bot Token
Click on Reset Token on the Bot Section:

After that,
you'll be able to get access to your token (After you clicked "Yes, Do it"
